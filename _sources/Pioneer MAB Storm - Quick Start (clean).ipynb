    "# Pioneer MAB Storm Example Activity / Python Quickstart\n",
    "Written by Sage Lichtenwalner, Rutgers University, May 23, 2024\n",

    "\n",
    "The Pioneer MAB Array was deployed in April 2024 off the coast of North Carolina, a bit north of Cape Hatteras.  While there are a number of ways to access data from the OOI, we will use the relatively new OOI ERDDAP data server, which provides a straightforward way to request and download data.  Erddap servers are used by a number of oceanographic data centers, so once you learn one, you can easily get around others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This example will highlight wind, wave and weather measurements made by the *Central Surface Mooring* during the [first storm](https://ocracokeobserver.com/2024/04/09/another-brief-storm-system-heading-our-way-thursday/) to pass by the array in late April.  Weather timeseries measurements tend to be easier for students to work with, as they tend to be straightforward measurements and students often have an intuitive understanding of what they mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "**At the end of this notebook activity, you will be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand how to use the *erddapy* library to easily load data from the OOI ERDDAP data server into a programming environment\n",
    "* Generate graphs of wind, waves and other variables from the Pioneer MAB Central Surface Mooring\n",
    "* Compare different techniques for plotting multiple variables/instruments on the same graph\n",
    "* Use 2 ways to select time periods for graphing (during download vs. plot axes limits)\n",
    "* Interpret the time relationship between multiple variables\n",
    "* Understand how to use the erddapy search feature to find other OOI instruments (optional extension)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pedagogical Approach**\n",
    "In addition to demonstrating how to use code to access and plot OOI data, this notebook will also (loosely) use the Engage-Explore-Make Meaning format to guide students through the activity.  You can find out more about this approach (which is a pared down version of the 5E constructivist model) on the [Polar ICE](https://polar-ice.org/about-us/polar-cap/) site."

    "## Engage - Finding a Wind Storm\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2024, a [coastal storm](https://ocracokeobserver.com/2024/04/09/another-brief-storm-system-heading-our-way-thursday/) passed the new Pioneer MAB Array off the coast of North Carolina. This was the first storm the new array measured. According to [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/@4470221/historic?month=4&year=2024), the highest winds during the storm were recorded late in the day on April 11.  Let's take a look at what the Central Surface Mooring recorded this month, to see how the storm compares with the rest of the month.  \n",

    "To start, we'll focus on wind.  Later on, we'll take a look at waves and turbidity to see how the storm impacted the waves and sediment in the ocean.\n",

    "### Step 0 - Setup the notebook\n",
    "In order to run code in this notebook, we will rely on several Python *libraries* that provide us with a number of functions to load, plot and deal with data.  To use these libraries, they must first be loaded into memory."
